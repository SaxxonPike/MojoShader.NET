# MojoShaderDotNet

A C# port of [MojoShader](https://github.com/icculus/mojoshader).
The license for this port is identical to the original source. This is
a work in progress; not all profiles are ported.

Many thanks to [Icculus](https://icculus.org/mojoshader/) for sharing
the original code with the world. Portability of shader code continues to
be an important part of game portability as a whole.

### Implemented profiles:

- Bytecode
- GLSL
  - GLES, partially
  - GLSL120, partially

### Further information:

Please check out the original MojoShader project linked above. However,
if you experience bugs or other issues with this shader, please do not
post the issue on that repo; use the 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/SaxxonPike/MojoShader.NET/issues) on
this repository instead. If there are improvements to the original
MojoShader that are not present or implemented here, that is also a good
candidate for opening a new issue.
